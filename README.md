# d6-rs

tiny, lightweight diceroll program
made this cuz i found out dice symbols exist

## installation and usage
clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ellipticobj/d6-rs.git && cd d6-rs
```

install
```
cargo install --path .
```

run
```
d6
```

## configuration


---

made with rust btw haha

## plans !
- [ ] customization? (animation time, output options, symbols)
- [x] more dice options
- [x] add a way to pipe just the value or to remove the symbol so bash scripting is easier
